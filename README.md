The provided database is so small that it is difficult to gain any insite into the pattern of appearances and types of UFO's.  However within a local area and time frame it is apparent that multiple UFO's appear.
Where not later discounted whitness accounts are hightly detailed and could be worked into the Encounter scale (I.E.: level 1, 2, 3)
